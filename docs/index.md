<p>
This is a collection of configuration files and code snippets for various projects and services that I use. These files serve as a reference and can be used for quick setup and deployment of different projects and services, saving time and effort in the process. 
</p>
<p>
The collection includes files for popular services such as AWS, GitHub, and various programming languages, as well as custom scripts and tools that I have developed.
</p>
<p>
This collection will continue to grow and evolve as I work on new projects and discover new tools and techniques.
