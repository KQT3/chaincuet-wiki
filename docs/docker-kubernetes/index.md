#### Docker & Kubernetes

<p>
Docker is a platform that enables developers to easily create, deploy, and run applications inside containers. Containers are a lightweight and portable way to package software, making it easy to deploy applications on any infrastructure. Docker provides a standard format for building and shipping containers, making it easier for developers to manage dependencies and ensure consistency across environments.

Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a way to organize and manage containers, making it easy to deploy and manage complex, multi-tier applications. Kubernetes automates many routine tasks, such as rolling updates, self-healing, and resource management, making it easier for developers to focus on building and delivering new features. Additionally, Kubernetes provides a unified API for managing and scaling containers, making it easier to deploy and manage applications across multiple environments.
